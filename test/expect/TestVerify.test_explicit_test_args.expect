When I exported your model with different inputs, the result was different.
(To get more information, run torch.onnx.verify(..., verbose=True))
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ERROR: Strings are not equal:

  graph torch-jit-export (%1) {
-   %2 = Mul(%1, %1)
?        ^^^
+   %2 = Add(%1, %1)
?        ^^^
    return %2
  }

  * A difference in model structure usually means that
    your model has dynamic control flow.  These models are not
    currently supported by the exporter.
