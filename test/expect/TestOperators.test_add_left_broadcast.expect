ONNX export failed: Couldn't export operator expand; this usually means you used a form of broadcasting that ONNX does not currently support

Graph we tried to export:
graph(%0 : Double(3)
      %1 : Double(2, 3)) {
  %2 : Double(2!, 3) = Expand[shape=[2, 3]](%0)
  %3 : Double(2, 3) = Add(%2, %1)
  return (%3);
}
